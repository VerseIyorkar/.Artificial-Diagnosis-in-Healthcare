# Exploring Diagnosis in Healthcare with Artificial Intelligence.

### Project Overview

This project aims to explore the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare for disease diagnosis, and patient overall satisfaction. A diagnosis is the detection of the behavioral pattern of a disease, based on the characteristics of one or more of the five disease causing agents namely; viruses,helminths,fungi,protozoa and bacteria. The Emergence of AI in diagnoses has reshaped the health industry by providing insights to detecting mild to lethal diseases. This unique paper contributes to previously established findings.



### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Synthetic Dataset for AI in Healthcare", containing information about Patients' medical information and the Artificial Intelligence diagnosis confidence level.



### Tools

- Microsoft Excel (Data cleaning and Analysis)
- SQL Server (Data Analysis) 
- R Studio   (Data Analysis)
- Tableau (Data Visualization)
